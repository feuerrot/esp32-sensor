# esp32 sensor stuff
Read some sensors (currently only BME280 and SCD30), display some values,
use MQTT to publish some other values.

## Missing stuff
* some sort of modularization (how does upip w√∂rk?)
* some sort of configuration
  * wifi (Connect to multiple ones?)
  * sensors (Detect connected ones?)
  * mqtt (Server and publish config)
